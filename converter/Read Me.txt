====================================
Mini Retro TV - Video Convertor v0.2
====================================


1.  Open MiniTV_Converter.exe
   ## Notes : Do not close the black Command Prompt window in the background.

2.  Enter full YouTube URL, and click Download.
   ## Notes : This will download the highest resolution available and store it in am MP4 format. 
      It also works with other sites like Rumble, BitChute, Dailymotion etc. 

3.  The crop function will crop the video prior to conversion to mjpeg.
   ## Notes : This can handle 480p, 720p and 1080p videos only. Cropping can take
      some time (1 min. per 10 minutes of video approx).

4.  Select Video and Make Small, converts a movie to the Mini Retro TV format (288_30fps.mjpeg).

5.  Select Video to Extract Audio, will convert the movie to ACC audio (44100.aac)

5.1 Optional : Select the Decibel (dB) level of the clip. 
   ## Notes : I've dropped MY sound level to -8DB (the default) because I didn't use an additional 
      100k resistor on the MAX98357 audio board. If you have used a resistor, try a higher value. 
      Warning: Setting a very high level could cause distortion, and may even damage the speaker.

6. Transfer the 288_30fps.mjpeg and 44100.aac files to the Mini Retro TV microSD card. Either 
   create a new folder (and call it 4, or 5, or whatever number is next), or overwrite previous 
   files in one of the numbered folders.
